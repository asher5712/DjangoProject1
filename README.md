# django-project-1
This is my first DJANGO web development framework practice project.

The django project is named "zf_corp" which is basically a fictional company for which a django webapp is required.The company provides the services and also contains a blog for the readers. The company home page or server app is "web_server" while the blog services provided are on the other app "blog_server".
The "web_server" is the fully functional website of the company describing the key elements, motives, features and contact services of the corporation. The services provided by the company are not yet decided.
